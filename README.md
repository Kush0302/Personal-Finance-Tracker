> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is currently a CLI-based personal finance tracker created for practice and learning purposes. In the future, I plan to convert it into a fully functional web application where users can log in, input their own financial data, view interactive charts, and track their income and expenses more intuitively through a clean, user-friendly interface.
